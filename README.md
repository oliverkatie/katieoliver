# HOW F1 TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING SOCIETY

Formula 1 is at the forefront of technology, pioneering new inventions that benefit life beyond the race track, from road cars to consumer electronics, from medical technology and to smart cities. 

## IMPACT ON SOCIETY 

Away from the roads, modern society is benefitting from formula 1â€™s technical innovations. Mclarens F1 Data is being used by air traffic controllers which help to reduce congestion, emissions and time. Mclarens Data is also now also a vital part of monitoring intensive care patients in hospitals. In addition to this, the study of how F1 pit crew operate, has encouraged better communication strategies between surgeons and nurses in operating theaters, among life-saving advancements.

## FORMULA 1'S TECH RACE.

Behind the twenty cars, each team is competing to have the best technology in order for their cars to have maximum performance, which creates innovations that we see in modern day society, F1 technology has become more relevant for road cars than it has ever been before.

### Carbon Fibre 
Carbon fibre was pioneered by Mclaren in 1980 to protect the driver's saftey, it's light but strong properties have allowed carbon fibre to sucessfully migrate into being manufactured into road cars. 

### anti-lock brakes (ABS)
ABS was first introduced in fomula 1 in 1971 but later banned in 1994 due to a backlash of the sport becoming too technical, Formula 1 would be even less about skill and more about technology if ABS was legal. However this did not matter for road cars, most cars in todays society will be built with ABS breaks 

4. KERS (kinetic energy resource system)
5. Hybrid technology

## HOW DATA IS COLLECTED
Data is collected through **telemetry**
