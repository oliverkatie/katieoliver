# HOW F1 TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCING SOCIETY

Racing on 23 different race courses requres the 10 teams to each compete every season to be the best, meaning that Formula 1 is at the front line of technology, pioneering new inventions that benefit life beyond the race track, from road cars to consumer electronics, from medical technology and to smart cities. 

## IMPACT ON SOCIETY 

### Sustainability 
Away from the roads, modern society is benefitting from formula 1’s technical innovations. Mclarens F1 Data is being used by air traffic controllers which help to reduce congestion, emissions and time. 

Formula 1 have stated that they will be carbon neutral by 2030, by 2025 all events should be 100% sustaiable and will be eliminating simgle use plastics, and reusing and recycling materials. Offices, factories, facilities and  emmisions will also have be powered by 100% renewable energy. 

### Communication
 Mclarens Data is also now also a vital part of monitoring intensive care patients in hospitals. In addition to this, the study of how F1 pit crew operate, has encouraged better communication strategies between surgeons and nurses in operating theaters, among life-saving advancements.
 
 In the future, similar technologies will move smartphones, enablalig much faster download and upload speeds and a more reliable connection, used in connected cars to enable them to communicate with the outside world.

## FORMULA 1'S TECH RACE

Behind the twenty cars, each team is competing to have the best technology in order for their cars to have maximum performance, which creates innovations that we see in modern day society, F1 technology has become more relevant for road cars than it has ever been before.

### Carbon Fibre 
Carbon fibre was pioneered by Mclaren in 1980 to protect the driver's saftey, it's light but strong properties have allowed carbon fibre to sucessfully migrate into being manufactured into road cars. 

### Anti-lock brakes (ABS)
ABS was first introduced in fomula 1 in 1971 but later banned in 1994 due to a backlash of the sport becoming too technical, Formula 1 would be even less about skill and more about technology if ABS was legal. However this did not matter for road cars, as ABS  is designed to stop your car from skidding when breaking sharply, by stopping the breaks from locking. Most cars in todays society will be built with ABS breaks.

### Hybrid Technology (KERS)
Kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) works by using the kinetic energy released from braking and transforming it into electric energy to help boost the car’s horsepower. KERS was used in motorsport in the 2009 season where it won two podiums but was later scrapped but then reintroduced to the sport in 2011. 

Volvo took inspiration to create their own mechanical flywheel system made out of **carbon fibre**.  Using KERS saves 25% of  fuel and shows a substantial decrease in emissions.

> “ the KERS system is well suited to traveling in city traffic where you typically accelerate and then brake repeatedly.”

### Traction control
Traction control systems use electronic sensors to automatically manage how much power is being put down to the pavement in an effort to prevent the wheels from spinning. Although commonplace on road cars today, traction controll systems were introduced in Formula 1 in 1994 but then banned in 2008, due to beeing too technological and went agaisnt the FIA regulations.

### Acive suspension 
An active suspension system, has the capability to adjust itself continuously to changing road conditions. By changing its character to respond to varying road conditions, active suspension offers superior handling, road feel, responsiveness and safety. The active suspension system, was introduced by Williams in 1992, It is now a commmon specification for manufacturers making road cars.

### Steering wheels
The steering wheels designed by F1 engineers have been replicated in our everyday vehicles, not the actual shape, but the controls and configurations they feature. In F1 the driver can change various settings at the couch of a button, with up to 25 buttons. These have inspired steering wheels that we see in road cars to change the music, or answer a phone call from the wheel. 
In recent years, the F1 wheels have been designed to light up and inform the driver of any red flags that could be affecting a race. In the future, we might start to introduce these to road cars to warn them of traffic signals.

## COLLECTING DATA

### Telemetry
Data is sent from the car to the boxes using from 1,000 to 2,000 telemetry channels, transmitted wirelessly using 1.5 GHz frequency.
Each car has from 150 to 300 sensors, once the car is within four metres of the pit lane, the majority of the data is transferred from the car to the engineers, at download speeds of up to 1.9 Gbits per second. (Transmitting one Gigabyte of data would take less than five seconds.) The team then will look at __computinal raw data analysis__ to look for patterns that indicate trends and failures of car components. 

The telemetry data can be accessed in real-time as the car travels around the track at speeds up to 350 km/h, so they can communicate with the driver as soon as something goes wrong, so the driver can correct using his steering wheel to achieve a higher performance.

### Tyres
Understanding the tyres are crucial as they are a key performance in F1, in practice, Infra-red tyre monitoring systems are fitted on to the car to get a picture of how different tyres work based on the environment conditions. Getting the data off the data as fast as possible is vital as the car is only stationary in the pits for a few seconds. In order to do this, engineers developed a system of two high-tech wireless technologies, these operate in the millimeter wave 60 GHz band, _5 GHz 802.11ac and Multi-gigabit 802.11ad Wi-Fi technology_ which allows the data to be transmitted wirelessly.
